# WhosThatPokemon
Here we write a machine learning program to classify pictures of Pokemon.
We use machine learning Python libraries including TensorFlow and Keras.
Results will typically be displayed in and Matplotlib.

Written by Shaun Miller using the Kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/thedagger/pokemon-generation-one.
This program follows some of the tutorial from the TensorFlow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification.

Download the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

We then run and test the model with a realistic Pokemon image designed by Joshua Dunlop.
A full gallery can be found on https://www.artstation.com/joshuadunlop/albums/1256278.
Some testing images contained in the repository include joshua-dunlop-charmander.jpg, joshua-dunlop-bulbasaur.jpg, and joshua-dunlop-aerodactyl.jpg.
To test different images, simply replace joshua-dunlop-alakazam.jpg with different file name in the following command.
Run and test the model:

```
python main.py joshua-dunlop-alakazam.jpg

```

The following PNG image is the result of a test with the image joshua-dunlop-alakazam.jpg.
